    "\n",
    "[Castelli et al](http://xlink.rsc.org/?DOI=c2ee22341d) performed DFT screening of $\\sim$19000 perovskite materials. Only a small number of the calculated candidate materials ($\\sim$20) were found to be sufficiently interesting for photocatalytic water splitting to warrant further experimental investigation. A genetic algorithm could reduce the number of calculations required to locate the interesting candidates. We will try to make 19000 into ?\n",

    "A GA takes a Darwinistic approach to optimization by maintaining a *population* of solution *candidates* to a problem (e.g. what is the best perovskite for water splitting). The population is evolved to obtain better solutions by mating and mutating selected candidates and putting the fittest *offspring* in the population. The *fitness* of a candidate is a function which, for example, measures the stability or performance of a candidate. Natural selection is used to keep a constant population size by removing the least fit candidates. Mating or *crossover* combine candidates to create offspring with parts from more candidates present, when favorable traits are combined and passed on the population is evolved. Only performing crossover operations risks stagnating the evolution due to a lack of diversity -- performing crossover on very similar candidates is unlikely to create progress when performed repeatedly. *Mutation* induces diversity in the population and thus prevents premature convergence. The figure below gives a simplified outline of the algorithm.\n",

    "Furthermore, the output of a GA run will be a selection of optimized candidates, which often will be preferred over only getting the best candidate, especially taking into account the potential inaccuracy of the employed methods. Thus a GA finds many applications within atomic simulations, and will often be one of the best methods for searching large phase spaces.\n",
