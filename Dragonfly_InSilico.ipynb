    "In this exercise you will use a Bayesian optimizer in a way similar to the way you used the SciPy optimizers in exercise 1 and 2. This exercise uses the `SilicoColorMixer`. Next exercise you will move to the LEGO robot, so make sure you do proper coding and experiment with parameters in this exercise to make the next one easier. "

    "You can [code your own Bayesian optimizer](https://machinelearningmastery.com/what-is-bayesian-optimization/), but unless you have something really specific in mind, you will often be better of using one of the many Bayesian optimizers readily available. Many of these in some way or another depend on [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html), a very popular Python machine learning library. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise we will use a very advanced optimizer, [Dragonfly](https://dragonfly-opt.readthedocs.io/en/master/). If you are up for it you can read [the paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.06694), but be aware that it is *really* difficult to grasp. Dragonfly is *not* user friendly, barely documented (which is sadly quite common for machine learning software), not updated for almost a year, and it is really computationally demanding, but it is able to reduce the number of function calls needed quite efficienctly. Since our function calls are rather slow when they involve physical experiments, this is a feature we really value. We could also have used the [Phoenics](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acscentsci.8b00307) optimizer.\n",
